                <p>In the third week we initially completed our first assignment. When I investigated the express delivery, I found that the speed of express delivery is a very serious problem. If it is like food or flowers, their freshness is a very important factor. First of all, we must ensure the speed to ensure the freshness of food and flowers, so I I have investigated the flower delivery as my first concept.


I search the history and development of the unmanned system on the Internet and found that the first unmanned system was used in the car. Then someone proposed the concept of the drone. I think the drone is very suitable for express delivery. When cars and bicycles are affected by traffic, only drones can pass through bustling streets, blocked scenes, and high-airless drones will not be affected.
And under the influence of no factors, the delivery speed of the drone is also very fast, he can directly transmit in a straight line distance, which guarantees the freshness of flowers and food.

The speed of transport and the integrity of the flowers are the first standard that customers assess when they receive the Flower

So in the class of August 30, each of us presented the gains from the first assignment.And based on our opinion, we initially decided the direction of our second assignment.When we did the investigation, we found that the loss of parcels during transportation is a very important issue.So we decided to propose a solution to this problem.

		   <p>We decided to come up with a solution that would solve the package loss and decide our ideas in the next week’s class.
Therefore, our team members went to do some interviews and investigations, and recorded according to the process of collecting packages by different people.
I think the best way to solve the problem of parcel loss is to transport. Different companies have different modes of transportation when transporting.
The best solution is to transport a person or machine through a small number of employees, and decrease the loss of the package after multiple transfers.

	    <p>I interviewed two girls who used to travel overseas. They often used overseas mail to buy goods. They also complained that Australia's transportation experience is particularly poor. Australian express delivery products are particularly slow and often take more than two weeks to receive the goods they bought,They are very dissatisfied with the Australian courier service.

				Previously on assessment 1, our group was focusing on parcel delivery. Based on the previous research and analysis, a primary problem has been revealed. Loss of parcel is a fairly often happening issue in the delivery business. There are various reasons lead to loss of the parcel. First and the most frequently happening case is sending to a wrong destination. As drop and go is quite common in Australia, if the parcel is dropped at a wrong place, everyone is going to ignore it. As a result, the original recipient can hardly track or even get the parcel. The number of transitions is another reason contributes to the loss of item. Based on an estimation, more than 80% of operation is done manually. Those operations include receiving, put away, storage, picking, and shipping (Dewa, Pujawan & Vanany, 2017). Various human errors happened in warehousing operations give rise to picking the wrong item or losing the item. Precisely, the more station the parcels go through, the higher possibility they get lost, vice versa.</p>

                <p>According to this question, we have proposed three solutions for parcel lost after interview and background research.
One of the team members suggested that the drone can be used to send direct mail between friends and friends, so that you can send the goods directly to the place you want to send without going through the post office.Another team member suggested that the error can be directly detected in the warehouse. Using the drone to transmit in the warehouse can reduce the chance of manual error. The probability of success of the machine is often much greater than the probability of artificial success. If it can be reduced in warehouse The error rate of the package, which can be found from the root of the problem to the solution.My idea is that you can use  the drone delivery directly send the parcel instead of manual delivery.Users can book the package to be delivered and the drone to be used on the mobile phone, and can reserve the time to deliver the goods, and the drone delivery has the advantage that the delivery speed is very fast, if there is emergency needed mail and parcels, it can be quickly delivered from the post office to the address you want。

As they are asked to speak out their thought when they are moving through our user interfaces, we can immediately jot down the parts that make them confused. After recording their feeling and reaction, we are able to do changes based on the collected response.This method can gain a detailed story behind users’ experience through open-ended questions.

                <p>After a series of evaluations, we finally choose Secure Delivery as our to-be-developed concept. There are 2 reasons that made it better than the others. First, the key findings from assessment 1 revealed that the majority of losing parcel was because of the Courier.  It is true that Parcel Distribution and Direct Delivery reduce the risk of parcel loss during the transition between warehouses, but Secure delivery is a direct solution to the problem. Second, it is probably not realistic to apply Direct Delivery when the parcel is traveling a long way. The battery of drones and weather changes becomes a huge problem yet they are some kind of engineering problem. Precisely we would like to go for the solution which is most likely to achieve in the coming future. As a result, we chose Secure delivery for further development.AutoV is designed to solve the problem that is currently in the delivery industry. Below is our original concept flow chart and design. And it will be further refined. We have got six major paths in our app, they are a brief description of the company, charges of using service, to start a delivery, to track the delivery, user’s profile and Q and A session.

For example, can the drone be sent directly to the home or use the drone to transport additional services? Based on these questions, I feel that adding an introduction to how to use Interface is necessary</p>

                <p>Based on the user evaluation, key findings include typography, flow, function, layout. First, Attendances mentioned the contrast between fonts and background is not enough. We ,therefore, re-correct the color of textbox in order to emphasize the fonts. Next, we did some changes on layout according to what participants revealed. For example, in the “choose you parcel “ page, we altered the distance between each options which made the layout more understandable. Besides, we united the fonts into Montserrat because it has been being the first place in the ranking of “most frequently used font” in UI design. Extracted from our interview, font size is one of the problems. So we altered the fonts size as well. Second, in our refining, we didn’t altered much on the flow, we just change the title name from “ order a drone” to “start delivery”. As former is confusing that participants thought they could buy a drone through our apps. Last, participants mentioned the bar menu is a repeated function and can be removed. So we abandoned the switching function in bar menu and only kept one home button on it.
